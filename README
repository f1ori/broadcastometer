BroadMultiMeter
===============

A Broad- & Multicast Meter to messure the amount of broadcast and
multicast traffic in the local network.

This might help to detect and to analyze broadcast storms, caused by
loops and bad user configurations.


Dependencies
------------

As this is written in haskell, ghc is needed.

The pcap-haskell binding is needed as well, install it:

sudo cabal update
sudo cabal install pcap


Run
---

So far I use this command. Root privileges are needed to access
the raw network interface.

sudo runhaskell BroadMultiMeter.hs
