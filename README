Broadcast-O-Meter
=================

The Broadcast-O-Meter messures the amount of broadcast and multicast
traffic in the local network.

This might help to detect and to analyze broadcast storms, caused by loops and
bad user configurations.


Dependencies
------------

As this is written in haskell, ghc is needed.

The pcap-haskell binding is needed as well, install it:

sudo cabal update
sudo cabal install pcap


Run
---

So far I use this command. Root privileges are needed to access the raw network
interface.

sudo runhaskell BroadMultiMeter.hs
